# Water Potability Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the Water Potability dataset to explore water quality and identify factors affecting potability. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL integration, and Power BI visualization to generate actionable insights.

## Objective

To analyze the Water Potability dataset and derive meaningful insights into the factors that affect water potability. The project covers:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Potability factor analysis
- Trend analysis
- Data aggregation and grouping
- SQL database integration
- Power BI dashboard for visualization

## Dataset

- water-potability
- The dataset contains various parameters like pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, etc., and a binary potability indicator.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Handle missing values and normalize fields.
   - Prepare cleaned data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze water quality parameters using statistical methods.
   - Visualize data distributions, trends, and correlations.

3. **Potability Analysis:**
   - Identify factors that strongly correlate with potability.
   - Compare distributions of potable and non-potable water.

4. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Investigate potential seasonal or regional variations.
   - Create visualizations to analyze trends.

5. **Data Aggregation and Grouping:**
   - Group data based on potability status.
   - Aggregate parameters to analyze differences.

6. **SQL Database Integration:**
   - Set up an SQL database to store cleaned data.
   - Execute SQL queries for data extraction and analysis.

7. **Power BI Dashboard:**
   - Develop a Power BI dashboard for data visualization.
   - Showcase potability distribution, factor analysis, and trends.
